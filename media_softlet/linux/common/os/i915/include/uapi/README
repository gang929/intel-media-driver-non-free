This directory contains a copy of the installed kernel headers
required by the iHD driver to communicate with the kernel.
Whenever driver needs new definitions for new kernel
APIs, these files should be updated.

These files in master should only be updated once the changes have landed
in the drm-next tree (see https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm/).

You can copy files installed after running this from the kernel
repository, at version the driver require:

$ make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/path/to/install

The last update was done at the following kernel commit:

    drm/i915: Allow user to set cache at BO creation

    To comply with the design that buffer objects shall have immutable
    cache setting through out their life cycle, {set, get}_caching ioctl's
    are no longer supported from MTL onward. With that change caching
    policy can only be set at object creation time. The current code
    applies a default (platform dependent) cache setting for all objects.
    However this is not optimal for performance tuning. The patch extends
    the existing gem_create uAPI to let user set PAT index for the object
    at creation time.
    The new extension is platform independent, so UMD's can switch to using
    this extension for older platforms as well, while {set, get}_caching are
    still supported on these legacy paltforms for compatibility reason.
    However, since PAT index was not clearly defined for platforms prior to
    GEN12 (TGL), so we are limiting this externsion to GEN12+ platforms
    only. See ext_set_pat() in for the implementation details.

    The documentation related to the PAT/MOCS tables is currently available
    for Tiger Lake here:
    https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/tiger-lake.html

    The documentation for other platforms is currently being updated.
