This directory contains a copy of the installed kernel headers
required by the iHD driver to communicate with the kernel.
Whenever driver needs new definitions for new kernel
APIs, these files should be updated.

These files in master should only be updated once the changes have landed
in the drm-next tree (see https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm/).

You can copy files installed after running this from the kernel
repository, at version the driver require:

$ make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/path/to/install

The last update was done at the following kernel commit:

commit 8d62a974ac5fa1609e57a54622eef71e87bace78

    drm/amdgpu: fix drm-next merge fallout

    That hunk somehow got missing while solving the conflict between the TTM
    and AMDGPU changes for drm-next.
